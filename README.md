## 👀 Why this repo? 
- My brother asked me to make this cause he played this litle game on his friend's *smart-watch*,yup that's a main reason.
- I just wanna recap ***java and swing***
- I want to learn and create a `jar` file
- I love creating games.🤩
- There is ***no proper repo*** in *git community*,so I made it.
